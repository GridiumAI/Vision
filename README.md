# Vision

Vision is a decentralized machine vision platform built on Gridium, designed to provide efficient image recognition and computer vision capabilities. It leverages distributed computing resources to handle large-scale image data and enhance processing efficiency. Vision uses advanced algorithms to perform real-time image recognition tasks, optimizing performance by dynamically allocating resources across the decentralized network.
Users can deploy Vision on Gridiumâ€™s network, where it provides seamless access to machine vision services. Once deployed, the platform allows users to access trained models and perform image processing tasks through a dedicated service. As Vision scales, the platform will track user contributions and incentivize them with rewards based on task completion, encouraging collaborative development within the decentralized network.
